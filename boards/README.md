the files are from "https://www.conceptispuzzles.com"

Explanations for xml files (taken from small_color.xml):

line like this:
<path color="7">6 13 5 13 4 13</path>

means using color 7 (can be found in <palette> and is "50f000"==green)
the path is ((6, 13), (5, 13), (4, 13)) which means the number is 3.
so this is basically the solution for the puzzle
data in <header> not that important
